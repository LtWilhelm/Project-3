### Overview of application
        This application uses NodeJS and npm's node modules to run multiple different processes based 
        on what is asked of LIRI.
        It uses a node-spotify-api package found at (https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-spotify-api) to 
        intake songs commands and spit out information about the song.
        It uses an api called [Bands In Town API](http://www.artists.bandsintown.com/bandsintown-api to 
        intake a band and put out information about upcoming concerts.
        It also uses moment.js along side the bands in town api to configure the dates correctly and legibly.
        I am also using OMDB's API [OMDB API](http://www.omdbapi.com)
        Both the bands in town API and omdb API is being run using the axios package
        It then uses 'fs' to append to a log file any commands fed to it
