                  "The Dungeons & Dragons roleplaying game is about storytelling
                  in worlds of swords and sorcery. It shares elements with
                  childhood games of make-believe. Like those games, D&D is
                  driven by imagination. Itâ€™s about picturing the towering
                  castle beneath the stormy night sky and imagining how a
                  fantasy adventurer might react to the challenges that scene
                  presents."
